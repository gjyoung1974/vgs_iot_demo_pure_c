# VGS IOT sensor network demo in pure C (Espressif IDF c99)

Poll a senor and leverage VGS Proxyt and Secure Vault To protect the data

Uses APIs from `esp-tls` component to make a very simple HTTPS request over a secure connection, including verifying the server TLS certificate.
 
- This demo will use an Espressif ESP* format device with Arduino bootloader.   
    esp8266, esp32, etc

- The demo shows how easy it is to safely, securely operate on sensor network data within the constraints of a low power - limited compute device which may need near wire speed processing at the backend
